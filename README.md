* Loop through each student in the list, print their name, and calculate the total average marks along with their grade.
* For each student in the list, access their respective data from the dictionary.
* To Calculate the average of student's assignment results, test results and lab results, call get_marks_average function.
* After calculate individual averages, call the marks_total_average function to compute overall weighted average marks of student.
* Check each student's grade by calling check_grade function.
* Calculate the overall class average and determine its corresponding grade.
